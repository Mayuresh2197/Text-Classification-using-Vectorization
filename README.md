# Text-Classification-using-Vectorization
This is an NLP Project to classify the type of a Loan based on the Complaint which is a Text field. 

The dataset for this project is https://github.com/srivatsan88/YouTubeLI/blob/master/dataset/consumer_compliants.zip?raw=true 

This project is my attempt at learning and understanding Text Analysis using Vectorization methods. I have referred to the AI Engineering Channel on YouTube which made it possible to do this.
